<p> Once upon a time,  in Afghanistan lived Amir, a 11 years old boy.  Amir was a orphan refugee:   his parents died a month ago because the Taliban invaded Afghanistan. From there on Amir lived alone. After 1 year, living along the street, begging for food to everyone  crossing  the road, he decided to go and live in a refugee camp, where he could find some friends and have an easier life. 
    Amirâ€™s first year at the refugee camp went well, but the atmosphere was really sad. Amir cried every night thinking to his family exterminated by Taliban.
    One night, he thought deeply about what to do for the future, and he had a brilliant idea. He could have left the refugee camp with his friends and find an other country where to live, in a peaceful country where he could have find some money and a work. He wanted to go to Europe, in Italy! He knew it was almost impossible, but with his friends and with determination he could have done it. There were different ways to reach that beautiful country, and he was very doubtful to which one was easier. </p>
