<p>Amir and his friends spent all their money for the rider that will bring them till Libia. When they crossed borders they needed to be very attentive because there were guards everywhere. Amir was really hopeful in this undertaking, meanwhile the other were very scared about being arrested just like Jasmin. 
    The journey was really long, but after hours and hours of hiding, they finally arrived to Libia, where some hours later they would hopefully take a boat to Italy. They slept near the shore, because they needed to be ready for the rubber dinghy. The following  morning the temperature was somewhat hot, and it was sunny, with some clouds getting close from west. The first hours on the dinghy were not difficult, but they were all starving and scared because in a few instants it was gonna rain. The sea started to be rough, and big waves crashed against the dinghy. From the distance, they saw a big, wave, the biggest wave they ever saw in their life, for a moment, they all thought that their lives were finished, but, by miracle the dinghy didnâ€™t pierce. They were still alive!
    They  survived for other 3-4 hours and finally, for the first time in their lives, they saw Italy. They all shouted for glory and it was the best moment in their lives. They lived peacefully in the South of Italy, and lived happily ever after. </p>
