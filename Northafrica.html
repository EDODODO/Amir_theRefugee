    <p>One night, secretly Amir caught secretly a bus that will bring him till Jordan. It would be a really long journey but it was the sole way to not be caught by the police. Amir was not alone, he had a group of other 3-4 people traveling with him. When they arrived to Jordan, they slept for 2 nights through the streets, they were caught by the police a few times, but they escaped. The last night before leaving  Jordan till Libia, something terrible happened. Jasmin, one of Amir’s friend was captured by the  JPS ( Jordan’s Police Station). Amir’s group was really sad, but they were doubtful to go and save him, or continue the journey without a member of the group. </p>
