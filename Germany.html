<p>Amir knows that the trip till Germany will be really long, but it is an excellent country for refugees, especially for finding work. Amir needs to be very attentive because in Europe there will be many controls for the identity. He doesn’t have a lot of money, and this is a big problem, he sleeps for a week near the street with other refugees trying to find desperately some money. One sunny day, Amir, saw an old man that walked near Amir and his friends, the old man was observing them attentively with his two brown eyes.  At a certain point he stopped, he bent down and gave 100 euros to them. Amir and his friends were so surprised, that they didn’t have the words to thank him. When the man walked away they all cheered and waved in the air the money they received. 
    Now, they were ready for the trip till Germany. After a while, they found a tir, that brought them till Belgrade ( Serbia).
     They slept there for one night, and since they had many euros left, they did dinner and the day after they left Serbia for Vienna. The journey was very long, but when they arrived, the police caught them, but miraculously they escaped. Finally, the last step was arriving in Munich. After 5 hours they finally arrived at Munich. Amir lived happily in Germany for the rest of his life and just after 1 month he became a student and found a work. </p>
