    <p>Amir lived for 5 years at the refugee camp. He decided that he would have found a job at the refugee camp. 
        He had many ideas in his mind: or he would have done a chef, since he always loved cooking, or the teacher, 
        because he was the only one at the refugee camp who went to school previously. </p>
