    <p>Amir found his father’s old friend that decided to ride them till Turkey free, without spending money. They were all excited for this magnificent journey. Unfortunately, they needed to hide during the trip since they were really close to Afghanistan. They knew that if they would have put effort in this mission they could have done it. The rider was really kind and he offered them some traditional Turkish food. The trip wasn’t too long and they arrived early in Turkey. The next step was getting a tir ( a little truck where usually people hide to overpass borders). The tir is really uncomfortable because there is not a lot of space and you need to hide under containers. It is not as easy at is seems to migrate secretly between countries. It was the most difficult and long road trip they ever had in their entire lives. They risked to be caught many times but they did it anyway.
        Greece was a really nice country, but Amir was determined to go in Italy. He met various people who became his friends who said that it is really difficult to go in Italy if you are a refugee, and that no one they knew did it. There Amir and his friends became very doubtful. They always loved Italy and it would have been a dream to live there, but it is really dangerous. However, Greece wasn’t so bad to live in, but they wanted to live in the best country. Maybe he could go in Germany, where it could be easier to live. </p>
